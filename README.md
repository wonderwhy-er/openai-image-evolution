# OpenAI Image Model Evolution Comparison

This project demonstrates the evolution of OpenAI's image generation capabilities by comparing the outputs of three different models side by side:
- **DALL-E 2** (2022) - OpenAI's second-generation image model
- **DALL-E 3** (2023) - Improved text understanding and visual quality
- **GPT-4 Vision with Image Generation** (2024) - Latest model with enhanced capabilities

## Live Demo

View the live demo: [OpenAI Image Generation Evolution](https://wonderwhy-er.github.io/openai-image-evolution/)

## Features

- Generate images from the same prompt using three different OpenAI models
- Compare the quality and interpretation differences across model generations
- Simple, responsive user interface
- Secure client-side API key handling (never stored)

## How to Use

1. Visit the [live demo](https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/openai-image-evolution/)
2. Enter your OpenAI API key (this is only used for API requests and is not stored)
3. Enter a prompt describing the image you want to generate
4. Click "Generate Images" to see the results from all three models

## Setup for Local Development

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/openai-image-evolution.git
   cd openai-image-evolution
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your web browser to run the application locally.

## Requirements

- An OpenAI API key with access to DALL-E 2, DALL-E 3, and GPT-4 Vision with image generation capabilities
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
2. Push your code to the repository:
   ```
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME/openai-image-evolution.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Enable GitHub Pages in your repository settings:
   - Go to Settings > Pages
   - Select "main" as the source branch
   - Click "Save"
   - Your site will be published at `https://YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME.github.io/openai-image-evolution/`
